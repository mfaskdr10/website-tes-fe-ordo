        The Green Haven Project - Mangrove aims to restore coastal ecosystems
        and raise awareness by planting mangroves and educating participants
        about the importance of these areas. This six-hour event will involve
        JCI members, local farmers, and students, focusing on combating beach
        erosion and promoting ESG values.
